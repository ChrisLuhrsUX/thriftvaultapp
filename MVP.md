# ThriftVault — MVP Launch Checklist

## Blocking (must ship — in order)

- [x] **Apple Developer Program** — enrollment complete
- [x] **App Store Connect app created**
- [ ] **RevenueCat subscriptions** — code side 100% ready (`hooks/usePurchases.ts`, `PaywallModal`, `monetization.ts`). Remaining = dashboard clicks + prebuild. See full sequence below.
- [ ] **Screenshots** — 6.7" and 6.5" iPhone (simulator or TestFlight build)

### RevenueCat — remaining sequence

1. **Paid Apps agreement** — App Store Connect → Business → bank + tax info. Real bottleneck (1–2 days to process). Do this first; nothing else works without it.
2. **Create 3 subscription products** in App Store Connect under a new Subscription Group ("ThriftVault Pro"). Use IDs `monthly` / `season` / `annual` to match `constants/monetization.ts` (or rename `monetization.ts` to match `tv_*` — just pick one and stay consistent).
3. **RevenueCat dashboard** — new project, add Apple App Store app, paste App-Specific Shared Secret (App Store Connect → App Info → Generate). Grab the public API key.
4. **RevenueCat entitlement + offering** — entitlement named `pro`, offering named `default`, add all 3 products as packages.
5. `npm install react-native-purchases`
6. Add `"react-native-purchases"` to `app.json` plugins array.
7. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY=appl_...` in `.env`.
8. `npx expo prebuild` — ⚠️ **after this, Expo Go no longer works on iPhone 13.** Must use `npx expo run:ios` with a dev client or a TestFlight build. Permanent dev-workflow change.
9. **Sandbox tester** — App Store Connect → Users and Access → Sandbox → create a sandbox Apple ID. Sign into it on device under Settings → App Store → Sandbox Account. Test full purchase + restore flow.

Detailed version lives in `REVENUECAT_SETUP.md`.

## Post-Launch

See [POST_LAUNCH.md](POST_LAUNCH.md) — scoped todos and unscoped ideas live there.
